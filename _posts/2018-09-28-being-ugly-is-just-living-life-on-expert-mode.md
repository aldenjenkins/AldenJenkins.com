The inspiration for this post comes from one of Elliot Hulse's videos.
If you're not familiar with
him and are interested in any aspect of personal development, please give his
channel a browse.
Had it not been for viewing a plethora of his videos when I was in High School,
I would not be who I am today.

One of the most beneficial lessons that I learned from an early age through
various forms of introspective
meditation is the concept of looking at abstract ideas differently than the
way that may be typically perceived.
While there are plenty of parallels in this concept to
programming -- solving a problem in a different fashion, trying to piece together
parts of a problem as they occur in the debugging, etc. -- most of the problems we face in life are
not binary in their solution. They are not just solved or unsolved, they are
_experienced_. It's impossible to see that the solution for the problem of being
broken up with by your lover is to simply understand that the universe
is doing this for an exact reason which will be presented to you at a later time
in your life's journey, and that
harping on what the exact lesson you are being taught is on the day after the breakup will only distance 
the lesson further from realization. That is, it's impossible to see that solution
until you realize that __everything that you experience in this life is here
to help you__.


## Everything Is Here to Help You


I don't have much to add to Elliot's wonderful explanation, just to reassure you
that what Elliot is saying about how each of our own soul's evolution is unique
from that of any other is 100% true. Your spiritual self, your highest self, your strongest self, your
__best__ self
is omniscient: It knows everything that can be known. However, it is not 
omnipresent: 
It has not experienced everything that there is to experience. This 
juxtaposition of our soul's nature is the driving force of spirituality: our 
soul wants to experience everything and 
your purpose in life is to develop the relationship with your highest self enough
to a point where you can work with your spiritual self in unison and allow 
it to achieve its purpose in this physical manifestation that is human form.

To better understand this idea that your soul has a plan for you, 
consider for a moment the 
concept that __everything is here to help you__. Think about the hardest times
that you struggled through in your life. Is there
a single time when you had a terribly difficult experience and you didn't come
out of it as a stronger, more developed, and overall better version of yourself? Where you did not learn
a lot about how you work under pressure, where your vulnerabilities are, and where
your strengths are? Maybe you were injured and weren't able to do what you love
anymore. The mature spiritual perspective of this scenario is that __every wound is a 
womb which provides you the opportunity to grow from__. 
Our spirits are so wise, that if we are doing something that
does not bring us fulfillment, they will make us depressed so that we are
given the opportunity to re-analyze where we are misaligned with our highest 
purpose.

The girl in contention in this video is simply a soul who has chosen to 
experience the life of "an ugly girl," because that is an experience it has
likely not had yet, or has not achieved what it wanted to if it had been before.
When you develop the ability to recognize this, meditation becomes 
easier and more gratifying, and your purpose in life becomes clearer. But if you
choose to say "poor me," life becomes harder because your soul puts obstacles
in the way for you so that you will eventually spiral into an introspective 
scenario where you can sit down and recognize your souls purpose as a truth.

### But I really think my soul's purpose is to be a Billionaire CEO

This could absolutely be the case! But you must objectively understand where
that sentiment precedes from first in order to transcend the likely-hedonistic
nature of that belief which could lead you down a road towards a big dead end
if you pursue it out of egotistical adulation instead of intrinsic spiritual motivation.

The physical universe is so unique because it allows us to be co creators with
the universe.
For example these two hands that we have allow us to build houses, plant food,
hold your child, etc.
Imagine every other universe that there could be, with  different laws of physics.
This experience is so unique and your soul knew exactly what it would experience
when it chose to come here. The most beautiful part of each of our soul's plans
is that we knew before being born into a human body that as Human beings,
we are given something that we must at least understand, if not transcend by the
end of our body's lifetime, our body's ego. 

Your ego is the thing that tells you not to dance when you really want to dance,
when you shouldn't sing even though your heart says sing, when you shouldn't
pursue a career in art even though you really want to, all because of the
social conditioning that it has been hardwired to believe and __fear__ since
conception. Once you can recognize this as a matter of fact, your journey
into unison with your soul's purpose, __what it came here to experience__
begins because you are now listening to your highest self instead of your
animal self. 

I'll leave you with the only hint you need about where to start this journey: **love**,
the driving force of energy in this universe.

Much of what I'm discussing here alludes to a deeper discussion to be had. One
that can't be understood by the archetypical explanation that is common in
today's society. Brace yourself for my next blog, because it's one about 
__God__.

----

With all of that being said, remember to always use this following video 
as your guide going forward to stay _authentic_ and _grounded_ in your spiritual
journey 
by not taking anything too seriously, and recognizing that your goal is not
to completely __kill__ your ego, but to come to terms with it for what it is
so that you can have a healthy relationship with it and learn to
__dance with it__. Because paradoxically, to do anything else is to not embrace
and love everything that you are! Get it? Aho!

Also keep in mind that __I still do not even know my exact purpose__, but
on my past 2-year long journey to understand it, I have learned incredible
amounts of knowledge that
have made me a stronger, smarter, more proficient, more developed, and more
loving human.
