I've learned plenty of lessons over the last year, and learning to enjoy every second of life has been one of the most beneficial. I began taking cold showers which propelled my interest in alternative medicine and the inherent power of the natural body. My whole life I had been perscribed Vyvanse for ADHD, but had always felt it turning me into more of a robot than a human. I discovered that through treating your body like an expensive car and letting live as it was engineered over millions of years to function, my ADHD symptoms

But what does living as naturally as possible entail?Â 

Enter Paul Chek, the Holistic Health Wizard. The first of Paul's videos that I ever saw got me so interested in taking cold showers that I just did it. I was so astonished by how good I felt after, that I started looking into what else I could be doing to improve my life naturally.

First, I started eating entirely organic.

After watching paul's video on the importance of REAL food, I understood where I could never cheap out again, the supermarket! Specifically, the farmer's market every Saturday.

Then I realized what was happening. I was developing a relationship with my body that I had been blinded to for all of my life.

We often become blinded by cultural and societal norms when listening to what our body needs. We let ourselves become slaves to external expectations and childhood indoctrintations that have molded our consciousness into a completely literal sense
