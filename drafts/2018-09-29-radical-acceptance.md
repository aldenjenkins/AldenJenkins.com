"What is it you are unwilling to feel?" is the one question worth pursuing.

It will help you realize what has stopped you from becoming the dancer your
parents never wanted you to be. It will help you understand what has been
keeping you from going to school to get an art degree. It will help you
understand what has been preventing you from going to the theatre to see the play that your friends will make
fun of you for when they _catch_ you going to see it.
It will help you understand what has been stopping you from taking time to
love yourself for who you are at your purest consciousness a pure embodiment of love. 

Is your method of walling yourself off from the traumas you have experienced during your life 
rage? Do you project your self-loathing onto others when they try to show you love?

Is what you are unwilling to feel the same thing that is keeping you from pursuing
your dream?

To realize what you are missing in your life, it helps to undestand that we are both products, children and 
embodiments of love in every sense of the phrase. You were born after your parents
made love. You are loved by everyone whether they like you or not.
What you will find is that you are likely unwilling to accept the love for yourself 
that you deserve unconditionally.

Once you realize this, you then realize that love is a virtuous cycle instead of a finite
amount. No one ever says to a mother after they give birth to their second child that
"it must be so hard to love your first child half as much now!" Love is infinite. That mother
has all the love for all of her children. Then you understand that the more love you
give to others, the higher your capacity to receive love! 

To be sound in mind and spirit takes radical acceptance. Acceptance of who you are,
what you have done, and what has happened to you. Understanding that everything
is okay and everything will continue being okay will be the guiding light - the shaman - 
on your journey of becoming the strongest version of yourself in everything that you do.

Spending some time on this thought will take you far.
